Just wanted to point out that we just posted a preprint on BioRxiv!
In "On the prediction of human intelligence from neuroimaging: A systematic review of methods and reporting" we collected the literature on the application of machine-learning to the prediction of intelligence from MRI, spanning 30 studies from 2008 through 2020.
See the Twitter thread for more details:

This preprint is part of my Thesis by the way.
Did I say that [my defense it's right around the corner?](/blog/2021/10/PhDDefense)
It will be held in November 17th, 2021.
Don't miss it!
