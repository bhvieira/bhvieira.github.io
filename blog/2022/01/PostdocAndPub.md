The end of 2021 has been frantic for me, so the page was devoid of updates for a while.

So, I just arrived in Switzerland for a postdoc with Professor Nicolas Langer at the University of Zurich.
Here, we will work on the exciting prospect of improving prediction of Alzheimer's progression from combined clinical and imaging information.

Also, I would like to anounce a new publication at the Brazilian Journal of Physics!
