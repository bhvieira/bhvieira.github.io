## Abstract
> Reviews and meta-analyses have proved to be fundamental to establish neuroscientific theories on intelligence.
> The prediction of intelligence using in-vivo neuroimaging data and machine learning has become a widely accepted and replicated result.
> We present a systematic review of this growing area of research, based on studies that employ structural, functional, and/or diffusion MRI to predict intelligence in cognitively normal subjects using machine learning.
> We systematically assessed methodological and reporting quality using the PROBAST and TRIPOD in 37 studies.
> We observed that fMRI is the most employed modality, resting-state functional connectivity is the most studied predictor.
> A meta-analysis revealed a significant difference between the performance obtained in the prediction of general and fluid intelligence from fMRI data, confirming that the quality of measurement moderates this association.
> Studies predicting general intelligence from Human Connectome Project fMRI averaged $r = 0.42 \ (\text{CI}_\text{95\%} = [0.35, 0.50])$ while studies predicting fluid intelligence averaged $r = 0.15 \ (\text{CI}_\text{95\%} = [0.13, 0.17])$.
> We identified virtues and pitfalls in the methods for the assessment of intelligence and machine learning.
> The lack of treatment of confounder variables and small sample sizes were two common occurrences in the literature which increased risk of bias.
> Reporting quality was fair across studies, although reporting of results and discussion could be vastly improved.
> We conclude that the current literature on the prediction of intelligence from neuroimaging data is reaching maturity.
> Performance has been reliably demonstrated, although extending findings to new populations is imperative.
> Current results could be used by future works to foment new theories on the biological basis of intelligence differences.
