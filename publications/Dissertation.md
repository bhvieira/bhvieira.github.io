This dissertation was written for the completion of my MSc in Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology,
under the ever productive supervision of Prof. Carlos E. G. Salmon at the University of S達o Paulo, Ribeir達o Preto, Brazil.
A special thanks to Professors Gabriela Castellano (IFGW - Unicamp), Koichi Sameshima (FM - USP) and Jo達o R. Sato (NINA, CMCC - UFABC) for accepting my invitation to compose my dissertation defense committee.

The main motivation behind this work was the fact that, while the literature on brain aging is very comprehensive on the main effects of age on the brain, co-occurrence or interactions between effects are often less studied.
