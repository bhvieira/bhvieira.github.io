## Personal

Born in the city of Araraquara, São Paulo but obtained my higher education in Ribeirão Preto, where I have lived ever since.
My personal interests include history, fantasy (in gaming, literature and worldbuilding), music theory, machine learning and neuroscience.
When not working, I spend quite some time browsing & answering questions in [Cross-Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/60613/firebug?tab=profile), occasionally in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bruno_H_Vieira), but not so much these days.
Amateur mandolinist in the spare time.

## Research interests

I have a deep interest in describing, understanding and predicting brain dynamics in vivo through neuroimaging and statistical analyses.

I also have a particular interest in fusing modern machine learning with brain imaging.
Machine learning has made many in-roads into neuroscience, and probably will continue to do so in the following years.
On the other hand of the spectrum, in neuroradiology the first machine learning-based solutions are starting to be approved for clinical uses.

Particularly, I believe there are promising results in a few areas of research that warrant more attention: 
1. Physics-informed model-based inversion (to accelerate acquisition and processing)
2. Deeper models in the study of individual differences in behavior & cognition
3. Architectures tailored to neuroimaging data 
4. Optimal control and neuroimaging fusion in autonomous diagnostic/theranostic systems
